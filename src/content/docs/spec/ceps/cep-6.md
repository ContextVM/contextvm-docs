# Public Server Announcements

**Status:** Final
**Author:** @Gzuuus
**Type:** Standards Track

## Abstract

This CEP proposes a public server discovery mechanism for ContextVM using Nostr replaceable events. The mechanism allows MCP servers to advertise their capabilities and metadata through the Nostr network, enabling clients to discover and browse available services without requiring prior knowledge of server public keys. This enhances discoverability while maintaining the decentralized nature of the protocol.

## Specification

### Overview

Public server announcements act as a service catalog, allowing clients or users to discover servers and their capabilities through replaceable events on the Nostr network. This mechanism provides an initial overview of what a server offers, and their public keys to connect with them.

Since each server is uniquely identified by its public key, the announcement events are replaceable (kinds 11316-11320), ensuring that only the most recent version of the server's information is active.

Providers announce their servers and capabilities by publishing events with kinds 11316 (server), 11317 (tools/list), 11318 (resources/list), 11319 (resource templates/list), and 11320 (prompts/list).

**Note:** The examples below present the `content` as a JSON object for readability; it must be stringified before inclusion in a Nostr event.

### Event Kinds for Server Announcements

| Kind  | Description             |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| 11316 | Server Announcement     |
| 11317 | Tools List              |
| 11318 | Resources List          |
| 11319 | Resource Templates List |
| 11320 | Prompts List            |

### Server Announcement Event

```json
{
  "kind": 11316,
  "pubkey": "<provider-pubkey>",
  "content": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-07-02",
    "capabilities": {
      "prompts": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "resources": {
        "subscribe": true,
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "tools": {
        "listChanged": true
      }
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleServer",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "instructions": "Optional instructions for the client"
  },
  "tags": [
    ["name", "Example Server"], // Optional: Human-readable server name
    ["about", "Server description"], // Optional: Server description
    ["picture", "https://example.com/server.png"], // Optional: Server icon/avatar URL
    ["website", "https://example.com"], // Optional: Server website
    ["support_encryption"] // Optional: Presence indicates server supports encrypted messages
  ]
}
```

#### Content Field Structure

The `content` field contains structured server information following the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle#initialization), it should be a JSON string.

#### Tags Field Structure

The `tags` field provides additional metadata for discoverability:

- **name**: Human-readable server name
- **about**: Server description
- **picture**: URL to server icon/avatar
- **website**: Server website URL
- **support_encryption**: Indicates server supports encrypted messages

### Capability List Announcements

As in the Server Announcement event, the `content` field contains a JSON string with the list of capabilities. The list is the result of a call to the `list` method of each capability.

### Tools List Event Example

```json
{
  "kind": 11317,
  "pubkey": "<provider-pubkey>",
  "content": {
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather information for a location",
        "inputSchema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "City name or zip code"
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "tags": []
}
```

### Discovery Process

#### Client Discovery Flow

1. **Subscribe to Server Announcement**: Clients subscribe to kinds 11316 (Server Announcement) on Nostr relays
2. **Subcribe to Capability List Announcements**: Once the server announcement is fetched and parsed, the client can subscribe to the capabilities events present in the server announcement.
3. **Initialize Connection**: Client proceeds with standard MCP initialization using the server's public key

An alternative flow is to subscribe to all announcements published by the server public key, and get all the public announcements at once, instead of first fetching the server announcement and then fetching the capabilities.

### Event Replacement Behavior

Since announcement events use kinds 11316-11320 (in the 10000-20000 range), they are replaceable:

- **Relay Behavior**: Relays store only the latest event for each combination of kind, and pubkey
- **Client Behavior**: Clients should always request the latest version of announcement events
- **Server Behavior**: Servers must update announcement events when capabilities change

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation can be found in the [ContextVM SDK server transport implementation](https://github.com/ContextVM/sdk/blob/master/src/transport/nostr-server-transport.ts). It is implemented by calling the list methods from the transport during the initialization of the transport and then publishing the results of those list methods.
